# Express React Auth Boilerplate

## Project Briefing

This is a simple boilerplate to get you started with full stack applications using Express and React, MongoDB is used as database and bootstrap css is used for UI. Yes, it's created in one of the most popular full stack technologies combination known as MERN. 

https://bootswatch.com/ is used to get a custom free theme made on top of Bootstrap. This is inspired by a Udemy Course by Brad Traversy and the project which it had. I'm basically using just the authentication part of it and modified the theme.

## Project setup

Simply install node modules for both frontend and backend, the project is already configured to serve build static files in production which is generated by React.

Concurrently, package is used for development and allows us to launch both frontend and back-end in one go using single command. Proxy is used for API calls made to the Express server inside the React application.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

For production, build the frontend of the app and then run the backend app only. 

```
npm run build
npm start
```
