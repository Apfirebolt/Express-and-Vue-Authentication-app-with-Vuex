## Project setup

Simply install node modules for both frontend and backend, the project is already configured to serve build content files in production which is generated by Vue which resides inside the build folder.

Concurrently, package is used for development and allows us to launch both frontend and back-end in one go using single command. Proxy is used for API calls made to the Express server inside the Vue application using the config file.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

For production, build the frontend of the app and then run the backend app only. 

```
npm run build
npm start
```
